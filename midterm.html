                <p class="body-text"> Cryptid Conquest's menu system is mostly used when you first open the game to navigate the several menus
                    including the main menu, settings, keybinds and credits menu. I implemented the functionality of transitions, some simple sound effects,
                    and visual feedback for whenever you click on a button to make the experience more satisfying as well. The menu system had difficult
                    to implement dynamic aspects to it, especially in game with the player hud and all of its components. 
                    I was able to implement a lot into the player's hud, from a timer, to an item display that keeps track
                    of how many of each item you have to a status effect bar that shows you what you're being affected by.

                <p class="body-text"> I designed and implemented the settings menu to have a few different functional options. The first feature I 
                    implemented was a mouse sensitivity bar that would do what you expect and affect how fast you can turn in game and look around with 
                    your given sensitivity. Next, I made two more sliders, this time related to volume of music and sound effects respectively. The way 
                    I implemented this was through the Unity Engine Audio Manager where I was able to group desired sound effects into two audio mixers 
                    and directly affect how loud all of the grouped up Audio Sources were. Lastly, the final two settings were checkboxes that
                    let you to have inverted camera controls and toggle sprinting.

                <p class="body-text"> The Weapon Select menu was a bit tough to implement as I wanted to make sure that it had enough player
                    feedback while also showing you important information and not being too cluttered visually. The Way I did this was by
                    using different buttons to let you select and set the player's loadout from the listed choices. When you would 
                    click on a new weapon or utility item, it would update the display, a short little description on the side of the menu to tell
                    you what the selected equipment would do in game. From this menu, we're able to either go straight into the game or go back 
                    to navigate previous menus.

                <p class="body-text"> The player hud was the most difficult part of the entire project as I had decided to design and then
                    implement a menu that had a lot of moving and dynamic aspects to it. To name the main features, there was a bar that displayed
                    icons for active debuffs and buffs, your items, your health, a cooldown area with live cooldown timers, a run timer, and a small 
                    square that displayed currency and enemy count. The timers were implemented using the Timer class in Unity and the UI elements 
                    were implemented through the use of varius custom structs and lists. I even implemented an item notification that shows up telling you
                    what your item that you picked up does that dissapears after a short few seconds.
