                <p class="body-text"> The melee combat system of planetarium was the biggest system I designed and implemented into our game.
                    As I mentioned on the home page, I made a feature rich melee collision system that was usable by both the player's weapons
                    and the enemies themselves. To go into more detail, the system was implemented to be optimized with the many 
                    collisions in the game. The way this is accomplished is by making all of the necessary colliders, and then
                    simply changing their position and how long they're allowed to collide with something. I also made sure to 
                    include variety with the types of collisions, the basic Unreal engine ones being sphere, cube and capsule colliders; and 
                    also adding a mesh based collider that would allow for more complex shapes like a cone. Collision effects can be simple 
                    damage effects, or you can hit actors multiple times and even launch them.

                <p class="body-text">The hammer was the first weapon that I had designed for our game with the melee system in mind. This weapon has 
                    a little bit of everything that my implemented system has to offer. This weapon uses the many different collision shapes available
                    to use while also using things like the multi-hitting functionality and launching ability. Implementing the hammer was an interesting
                    challenge as a different programmer designed and implemented a foundational system to the game for the player to be able to swap 
                    between chosen weapons freely. My work mainly came from designing the actual abilities and implementing them to a class I had to
                    create that used the parent weapons class. Attaching additional functionality to the hammer's attacks to make sure they came out
                    at the right time and even pushing to make the melee class even more flexible were all problems I had to solve with the implementation
                    of the weapon.

                <p class="body-text"> The shield was the first utility item in our game that I designed and implemented that used the melee collision
                    system for something other than attacking. Implementing the Sword and Hammer was a straight forward process with most of the 
                    functionality being designed around simply donig damage. However, the shield only had a single launching attack and the rest of its abilities 
                    were defense focused. Detecting which direction you had been struck from and determining if something should happen as a result was a difficult
                    task as it was a new problem to solve. Realizing I had access to the necessary variables from collision information 
                    however, I quickly implemented a solution that used vector math to determin the direction in which the attack was coming from and 
                    if the damage it dealt should be reduced as a result.

            Shotgun

                <p class="body-text"> The shotgun I designed was implemented in a rather unorthodox manner. Designing the shotgun to be a short ranged weapon 
                    with a ton of damage potential made sense, but making the necessary functionality to make the gun feel like it needed great accuracy 
                    was not desireable. I implemented the shotgun's abilities through the use of
                    my melee collision system. All but one ability of the shotgun is made with different melee colliders, mostly using the mesh collider
                    to be able to attack enemies in a cone like you would expect from a regular shotgun. The other difficulty was using the projectile 
                    system that the other Gameplay Programmer had implemented as it was a different system than mine and trying to mix them in one 
                    weapon was a challenge. Solving this problem came down to simply changing how the logic worked for that one specific ability when 
                    it was active.
