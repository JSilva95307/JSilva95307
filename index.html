                    <p class="body-text">Planetarium is a third-person looter shooter and the game I worked on the longest. This project had
                        around 4 months of development time from the initial design to the final product. Planetarium was my first project made with Unreal Engine
                        5.2 and was my biggest growth point as a programmer with the engine. This project was developed by a team of 5 programmers and 2
                        artists. I was one of the two gameplay system programmers for this project, taking more of a focus on the melee systems of the games.
                        In this project, I designed and implemented a robust melee system that included features such as multi-hitting attacks, customizable directional
                        launching attacks, and the ability to detect the direction an attack hit you from. The system was designed and implemented
                        to be used by both the player and enemies while also being optimized to increase performance.

                    <p class="body-text">Cryptid Conquest is my second biggest project so far, having 2 months of development time, Cryptid Conquest is a roguelike
                        game with a few different weapons and support items, each with their own abilities and uses. In this project, I was one of four programmers, my
                        role was to be the UI programmer in making sure that we had the necessary menus, visual feedback, and transitional functionality to make sure we
                        could switch between levels quickly and seamlessly. As I said, My main responsibilities were with the menus and little user feedback sections such
                        as a quick menu you could bring up with the tab key, the item pick-up visual, and the short transition screens. I also worked on designing and implementing
                        a settings menu and all the individual effects that they had. The settings menu was also set up to save your set settings in between sessions of the
                        game so you wouldn't have to set them every time you opened the game.

                            was completed in a four week time limit. I was quite pleased with myself for having completed this project since up to 
                            that point, I had only started learning how to program for about 3 months prior. Additionally, not only was this my first difficult large 
                            project, it was also where I first learned how to read documentation with a new resource, WXWidgets. Using this GUI, I 
                            created the simulation with a few different features. The features included the ability to save the maps you liked, a random map generator using 
                            a default seed or a seed provided by the user, map loading from previously saved maps, cell coloring customization, custom map sizes, and the options to choose a finite or
                            wrapping map.
